# Convert JS Test Driver output from XML to JSON

This simple command line tool allows you to easily convert the XML generated by JS Test Driver to an easy to consume JSON format.

##Pre-reqs
To use this tool, you'll need to have [node.js][node] (v0.4 or greater) and [npm][] installed. I've tested the tool on OSX and Linux, but it should work fine on Windows as well.

[node]: http://nodejs.org/
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/

##Install

    git clone git://github.com/sethmcl/jtd-xml-to-json.git
    cd jtd-xml-to-json
    npm install

Alternatively, you can use npm to install the package:

    npm install jtd-xml-to-json

If you want to run the unit tests:

    cd node_modules/nodeunit
    sudo make install
    cd ../../
    nodeunit tests/

##Usage

Using the tool is easy. Simply run `bin/jx2j file.xml`, where `file.xml` is an output file from JS Test Driver. The JSON format of this data
will be printed to stdout.
